# Quick Start Guide - Leia's AI Tutor

## Step 1: Get Your API Key

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy the API key you receive

## Step 2: Create Your .env File

Create a new file named `.env` (exactly this name, including the dot) in the project folder (`leai_tutor`) with this content:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=paste_your_actual_api_key_here
```

Replace `paste_your_actual_api_key_here` with the key you copied in Step 1.

**Important:** Make sure to paste the actual API key, not the placeholder text!

## Step 3: Run the Application

Open a terminal/command prompt in the project folder and run:

```bash
python -m solara run app.py
```

(Note: If `solara` command is in your PATH, you can also use `solara run app.py`)

The application will start and automatically open in your web browser at http://localhost:8765

## Troubleshooting

**"GEMINI_API_KEY not found"**
