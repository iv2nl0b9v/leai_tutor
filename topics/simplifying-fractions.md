# Simplifying Fractions

## Learning Objectives
- Understand what GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) means
- Find the GCD of two numbers
- Simplify fractions by dividing numerator and denominator by their GCD
- Recognize when a fraction is already in simplest form

## Materials

### What is a Fraction?

A fraction represents a part of a whole. It has two parts:
- **Numerator** (top number): how many parts we have
- **Denominator** (bottom number): total parts in the whole

For example, in the fraction 3/4:
- 3 is the numerator
- 4 is the denominator

### What Does "Simplifying" Mean?

A fraction is in **simplest form** (or **lowest terms**) when the numerator and denominator have no common factors except 1.

For example:
- 3/4 is already simplified (only common factor is 1)
- 6/8 is NOT simplified (both can be divided by 2)

### Finding the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)

The GCD is the largest number that divides evenly into both the numerator and denominator.

**Example:** Find GCD of 12 and 16
- Factors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12
- Factors of 16: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16
- Common factors: 1, 2, 4
- **Greatest** common factor: **4**

### Steps to Simplify a Fraction

1. Find the GCD of the numerator and denominator
2. Divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCD
3. Write the resulting fraction

### Worked Example: Simplify 12/16

**Step 1:** Find the GCD of 12 and 16
- Factors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12
- Factors of 16: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16
- GCD = 4

**Step 2:** Divide both parts by the GCD
- 12 รท 4 = 3
- 16 รท 4 = 4

**Step 3:** Write the answer
- 12/16 = 3/4

### Another Example: Simplify 15/25

**Step 1:** Find the GCD of 15 and 25
- Factors of 15: 1, 3, 5, 15
- Factors of 25: 1, 5, 25
- GCD = 5

**Step 2:** Divide both parts by the GCD
- 15 รท 5 = 3
- 25 รท 5 = 5

**Step 3:** Write the answer
- 15/25 = 3/5

### Quick Check

A fraction is simplified when you can't find any number (except 1) that divides evenly into both the top and bottom.
