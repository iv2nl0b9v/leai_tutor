### What is Double Digit Multiplication?

Double digit multiplication means multiplying two numbers that are both between 10 and 99.

For example:
- 23 × 45
- 67 × 18
- 52 × 34

### Understanding Place Value

Each digit in a two-digit number has a place value:
- **Tens place** (left digit): represents groups of 10
- **Ones place** (right digit): represents individual units

For example, in the number 23:
- 2 is in the tens place (represents 20)
- 3 is in the ones place (represents 3)

### The Standard Algorithm Method

The standard algorithm breaks multiplication into steps:

1. Multiply the first number by the ones digit of the second number
2. Multiply the first number by the tens digit of the second number
3. Add the two results together

**Important:** When multiplying by the tens digit, remember to add a zero placeholder (or shift left one position).

### Worked Example: 23 × 45

Let's solve this step by step using the standard algorithm:

```
    23
  × 45
  ----
```

**Step 1:** Multiply 23 by 5 (the ones digit of 45)
- 3 × 5 = 15 (write 5, carry 1)
- 2 × 5 = 10, plus carried 1 = 11

```
    23
  × 45
  ----
   115  (23 × 5)
```

**Step 2:** Multiply 23 by 4 (the tens digit of 45)
- Remember: 4 is in the tens place, so we're really multiplying by 40
- 3 × 4 = 12 (write 2, carry 1)
- 2 × 4 = 8, plus carried 1 = 9
- Add a zero placeholder on the right

```
    23
  × 45
  ----
   115  (23 × 5)
   920  (23 × 40)
```

**Step 3:** Add the two results
- 115 + 920 = 1,035

```
    23
  × 45
  ----
   115
 + 920
------
 1,035
```

**Answer:** 23 × 45 = 1,035

### Another Example: 34 × 52

**Step 1:** Multiply 34 by 2 (the ones digit)
- 4 × 2 = 8
- 3 × 2 = 6

```
    34
  × 52
  ----
    68  (34 × 2)
```

**Step 2:** Multiply 34 by 5 (the tens digit)
- 4 × 5 = 20 (write 0, carry 2)
- 3 × 5 = 15, plus carried 2 = 17
- Add zero placeholder

```
    34
  × 52
  ----
    68  (34 × 2)
  1700  (34 × 50)
```

**Step 3:** Add the results
- 68 + 1,700 = 1,768

```
    34
  × 52
  ----
    68
 +1700
------
 1,768
```

**Answer:** 34 × 52 = 1,768

### Another Example: 27 × 63

**Step 1:** Multiply 27 by 3 (the ones digit)
- 7 × 3 = 21 (write 1, carry 2)
- 2 × 3 = 6, plus carried 2 = 8

```
    27
  × 63
  ----
    81  (27 × 3)
```

**Step 2:** Multiply 27 by 6 (the tens digit)
- 7 × 6 = 42 (write 2, carry 4)
- 2 × 6 = 12, plus carried 4 = 16
- Add zero placeholder

```
    27
  × 63
  ----
    81  (27 × 3)
  1620  (27 × 60)
```

**Step 3:** Add the results
- 81 + 1,620 = 1,701

```
    27
  × 63
  ----
    81
 +1620
------
 1,701
```

**Answer:** 27 × 63 = 1,701

### Checking Your Answer

Use estimation to check if your answer makes sense:
- Round each number to the nearest ten
- Multiply the rounded numbers
- Compare to your actual answer

**Example:** For 23 × 45
- Round: 20 × 50 = 1,000
- Our answer was 1,035 ✓ (close to 1,000, so it makes sense!)

### Quick Tips

1. Keep your numbers aligned by place value
2. Don't forget the zero placeholder when multiplying by the tens digit
3. Double-check your carrying
4. Use estimation to verify your answer is reasonable
